# cw-plus
This is a collection of specification and contracts designed for use on real networks. They are designed not just as examples, but to solve real-world use cases, and to provide a reusable basis to build many custom contracts.

## cw-nfts

This repo is the official repository to work on all NFT standard and examples in the CosmWasm ecosystem. cw721 and cw721-base were moved from cw-plus to start this repo, but it shall evolve as driven by the community's needs.

Please feel free to modify cw721-base as you need to support these projects and add many extensions and additional standards (like cw-2981) to meet the demands of the various NFT projects springing forth.
